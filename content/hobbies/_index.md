- **Long-distance running** — I enjoy seaside routes and half marathons; training logs focus on steady aerobic base and recovery.
- **Yoga & breathwork** — gentle flows and mobility to balance running volume.
- **Theatre & cinema** — I follow European festivals and contemporary plays; I like writing short reviews.
