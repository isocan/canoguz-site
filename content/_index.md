## Open to research roles (Academia / AI for Science / ML for Materials)

I’m a **Computational Materials Scientist** working at the intersection of **machine learning** and **atomistic simulation (DFT)** to accelerate discovery of electrocatalysts and understand surface reactivity.

**Core focus**
- **ML + DFT workflows** for surface science and electrocatalysis (HER/ORR)
- **Equivariant GNNs / interatomic potentials** (e.g., MACE, NequIP, Equiformer-style)
- **High-throughput screening** on HPC + robust, reproducible pipelines
