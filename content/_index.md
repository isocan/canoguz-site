## Open to roles in **AI for Science / ML for Materials / Research Engineering**

I’m a **computational materials scientist** who builds **machine-learning + simulation** workflows to accelerate discovery and decision-making. I’m currently a **researcher at [DIFFER — Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research](https://www.differ.nl/)** in Eindhoven, NL, where I work on data-driven materials discovery.

## What I do
- **ML + scientific modeling**: build reliable pipelines that combine learned surrogates with physics/DFT to cut iteration time and cost.
- **Production-minded data work**: clean data, craft features, train/evaluate models, and ship robust artefacts (reports, dashboards, APIs).
- **Collaboration first**: I enjoy team competitions, open repos, and reproducible research.
- **ML + DFT workflows** for surface science and electrocatalysis.
- **Equivariant GNNs / interatomic potentials** (e.g., MACE, NequIP, Equiformer-style).
