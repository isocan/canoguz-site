Hi — I’m **Ismail Can Oguz**, a computational materials scientist working at the intersection of **machine learning** and **density functional theory (DFT)** for **electrocatalysis and energy materials**.

I build ML-assisted workflows for (i) catalyst screening, (ii) structure–property modelling, and (iii) accelerating simulation → insight → design loops.

## What I’m looking for
I’m currently interested in roles such as:
- **Research Scientist / Research Engineer (AI for Science, Materials)**
- **Computational Materials Scientist**
- **ML + Atomistic Simulation / DFT + ML positions**

I enjoy projects where the goal is *real* scientific progress: robust data, reproducible pipelines, and models that help decide what to compute/measure next.

## Core skills
- **Atomistic simulation:** DFT workflows, surfaces/adsorption, thermochemistry concepts
- **Machine learning:** GNNs for atomistic systems, feature engineering, model evaluation, uncertainty-aware screening
- **Scientific software:** Python, ASE-style workflows, HPC/SLURM, reproducibility & automation
- **Communication:** publications, collaborative research, technical writing
