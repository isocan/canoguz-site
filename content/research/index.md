## Research overview
My research focuses on **AI-accelerated discovery and understanding of materials** for electrochemical energy conversion. I combine:

1. **Physics-based modelling (DFT)** to generate reliable energetics and structure insights  
2. **Machine learning** to generalize patterns and reduce computational cost  
3. **Workflow automation** to scale screening while keeping results reproducible

## Current interests
### 1) Electrocatalysis and interfacial chemistry
- adsorption energetics and activity descriptors  
- stability vs activity trade-offs  
- realistic modelling choices (coverage, solvent approximations, uncertainty)

### 2) ML for atomistic systems (GNN potentials + property prediction)
- structure-aware representations for surfaces and adsorbates  
- in-domain vs out-of-domain detection  
- calibrated ranking for high-throughput screening

### 3) Reproducible, scalable pipelines
- automated dataset curation (deduplication, metadata, provenance)  
- HPC-ready workflows (job arrays, checkpointing, failure recovery)  
- transparent reporting: “what changed and why”

## What I want to build next
I’m excited by teams building **AI4Science** systems that connect:
- data generation (simulation/experiment)
- model training + evaluation
- decision-making (what to test next)
- interpretation (why it works)

If your group works on **materials discovery**, **DFT/ML integration**, or **autonomous/closed-loop research**, I’d love to connect.
